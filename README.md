## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or above.

```sh
npm install --save @cypress/env-or-json-file
```

## Use

If you have configuration file locally `foo.json` with all your settings,
load it directly

```js
const {configFromEnvOrJsonFile} = require('@cypress/env-or-json-file')
const config = configFromEnvOrJsonFile('foo.json')
if (config) {
  // ok, loaded somehow
} else {
  console.error('Missing config...')
}
```

But when you move to CI, just grab the file's contents and put it as
environment variable `foo_json` (environment variables often have restrictions
on characters, so replace all `/.-` characters in the path with `_`)

```sh
cat foo.json | pbcopy
```

Paste the contents into CI variable `foo_json` and it should load the config
on CI without checking in a sensitive file.

## Debug

To see verbose log message from this module, run with
`DEBUG=env-or-json-file ...` environment variable.

## Filename

Given a filename with path, function `filenameToShellVariable` converts it to
environment key name, normalizing slashes and dots.

```js
const {filenameToShellVariable} = require('@cypress/env-or-json-file')
filenameToShellVariable('foo/bar/.me.json')
// foo_bar__me_json
```

## Tips

* To prevent committing sensitive files use
  [ban-sensitive-files](https://github.com/bahmutov/ban-sensitive-files)
* Make sure CI does NOT leak environment variables to forks, like
  [CircleCI does](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/fork-pr-builds/)
